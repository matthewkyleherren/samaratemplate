                        Reserving Your Backyard. You agree to pay Samara a
                        deposit to reserve your Backyard. By reserving a
                        Backyard, you are offering to purchase a Backyard.
                        Following receipt of your deposit, Samara will make an
                        assessment of your property based on the information
                        provided by you. If we determine that the installation
                        of the Backyard is not feasible, we will refund your
                        deposit within [x] days from our notice to you. If your
                        property reasonably meets the requirements and criteria
                        for installation of the Backyard, we will schedule a
                        visit to your property. If your property meets our
                        requirements and criteria after that visit, we will send
                        you a proposal which will include a Purchase Order and
                        Construction Contract which you will then need to sign
                        for the purchase and installation of your Backyard. Any
                        such purchase is subject to approval of project
                        financing in addition to the terms of the Purchase Order
                        and Construction Contract.

                                litigated in a civil court of competent

                                EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
                                YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
                                PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
                                OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the
                                parties’ Dispute is resolved through
                                arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
                                another person’s claims with your claims, and
                                may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                                representative or class proceeding. If this
                                specific provision is found to be unenforceable,
                                then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution
                                section shall be null and void.
                            </li>

                                Severability. With the exception of any of the
                                provisions in Section 15(f) of these Terms
                                (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or
                                court of competent jurisdiction decides that any
                                part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable,
                                the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        General Terms.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the
                                entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
                                between Samara and you regarding the Services,
                                and these Terms supersede and replace all prior
                                oral or written understandings or agreements
                                between Samara and you regarding the Services.
                                If any provision of these Terms is held invalid
                                or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of
                                competent jurisdiction, that provision will be
                                enforced to the maximum extent permissible and
                                the other provisions of these Terms will remain
                                in full force and effect. Except where provided
                                by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may
                                not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation
                                of law or otherwise, without Samara’s prior
                                written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or
                                transfer these Terms absent our consent or your
                                statutory right, without such consent, will be
                                null. Samara may freely assign or transfer these
                                Terms without restriction. Subject to the
                                foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to
                                the benefit of the parties, their successors and
                                permitted assigns.

                                Notices. Any notices or other communications
                                provided by Samara under these Terms will be
                                given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the
                                Services. For notices made by email, the date of
                                receipt will be deemed the date on which such
                                notice is transmitted.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Waiver of Rights. Samara’s failure to enforce
                                any right or provision of these Terms will not
                                be considered a waiver of such right or
                                provision. The waiver of any such right or
                                provision will be effective only if in writing
                                and signed by a duly authorized representative
                                of Samara. Except as expressly set forth in
                                these Terms, the exercise by either party of any
                                of its remedies under these Terms will be
                                without prejudice to its other remedies under
                                these Terms or otherwise.
